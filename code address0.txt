It attacks by dropping bombs from the air and described as a strong figure. However, it seems to be weak before melee, because it shows a lot of losing to Tung Tung Saru. For some reasons, in Korea, it is often confused with Bomb Bardio, not in spring.

Crocodile of bombing Bom Bardiro Crocodilo's story

At one time in the tranquil high zone in the southern Italy, there was a crocodile named Bardiro Crocodilor.
He was not just a crocodile.
Since birth, a mini bomber wings have been on the back, and the missile launch sounds instead of horses.
People were afraid of calling him a crocodile of bombing.
His footsteps were the precursor of the disaster that would soon fall from the sky.
But no one knew.
Bombardi has never wanted war.
He was actually a crocodile who loved peace. At night, I quietly listened to the drill hymns, and I used to look at the stars under the moonlight.
His poetry title was "heavier minds than missiles."
One day, in the human world, the experiments of 'strange animals' began to be used as a combat weapon, and Bombiri was forcibly dragged and trained as a combat crocodile.
The wings on his back are now remodeled as a real bomber component, not a tool for peace.
On the battlefield he destroyed numerous things. Friends, memories, even myself.
Eventually, one day he accidentally bombed a child's house.
The child was not dead, but cried and shouted at Bardiro.
"Why is that? Why do you hurt us?" At that moment, Spring Bardi flew to heaven.
To avoid bombing anymore. To avoid hate yourself anymore. Throughout the clouds he disappeared, and people remembered the last moment he saw him.
"Crying in the sky, a winged crocodile."
Since then he has not returned. But one of his poems is still somewhere in the swamp.
The title was changed. "Can you love Crocodil?"",

Professor Ruthdi, mentioned here, refers to Brandon Curington, a black homosexual, and an influencer of black homosexuals who use the erotic barber ID in Indonesia. Dreamybull , the beginning of this character, is a popular meme in Indonesia, so it seems to have been tied up.

Boneca Ambalabu story

Boneca Amvalabu
It was a clear green, a small frog.
One summer day,
I went on a long trip with my family.
The sunshine is dazzling,
The stream flowed as if it were singing.
The moment I stopped to add oil,
The ground splits
Black oil broke out.
Boneca was surprised and tried to run away
It's already late.
Sticky oil wrapped his body,
Soft skin hardened.
Tire instead of legs,
Instead of a light body, heavy shells are formed.
Boneca could no longer sing.
The family disappeared in confusion,
He was left alone.
After that day,
Boneca Amvalabu
I started walking on an empty road.
No one can recognize it,
On the road that no one waits.
Occasionally, when the smell of oil is strong
He mumbles quietly.
“I can go back?”",

Brr Brr Patapim story


Brer Brer Patta Pim was originally the most pleasant being in the woods.
Blow the leaves with a large nose,
I applauded with a coarse foot and made everyone laugh in the forest.
Birds, trees, and even stones danced according to his laughter.
But one day
A strange bottle spread in the forest.
The trees withered, the animals left, and the forest died.
Pata Pim thought.
"If I can save this forest ... I'll do anything."
So he prayed earnestly to the spirit of the forest.
"I'll plant my laughter on the ground. Let me laugh again."
The spirits gave him his wish, but the price was great.
Pata Pim's body has become more and more rooted.
The arm is branch, the legs are rooted,
His bright laughs spread somewhere in the forest.
Even now, when I walk somewhere in the forest
There is a sound that is heard in the wind.
“Br ... Brand… Pata Pim…”
that,
One day is the last breath of a being who left a laugh for the forest.",

Lirily Larila was a long time ago.
As a child, he grew up in a small sand village.
He was always waiting for someone.
Waiting for raining,
Waiting for the wind,
People waited to come back.
But over time
Sand swallowed everything,
The villages, people, and promises have disappeared.
Lirily Larila finally made a wish.
“I will wait.
I hope you can meet everything that has disappeared someday. ”
The wish did not come true.
Instead, his body was slowly covered with thorns.
The flesh was dry,
The voice went out into the sand.
He becomes a cactus
I started walking the endless desert.
There was no way under the foot.
In front, back, and anywhere.
But Lirily Larila didn't stop.
The faint hope that you can meet someone,
Only that little wind remains.
He walked in the sand breeze today.
With a name that no one knows,
Along the road there is no one.",

It is a shark character with three legs on the beach with Nike sneakers. Italian brainrot memes are the beginning and the most famous character , the initial character, so the only explanation is not related to the photo. It is expressed as a rivalry with Bombardiro Crocodilo and is believed to be strong as it is famous.[4] However, there is little to do other than walking, so it is often described as the weakest . It is a hobby to enjoy Fortnite like the sons, Tralalalalitos .

Sharks wearing shoes
People laughed at him.
Sharks wore shoes.
The appearance of wearing blue Nike sneakers
Cute, funny, strange.
But no one asked.
Why is the shark walking on the ground?
Tralallar Tralala originally a deep place in the sea,
He lived in the darkness that could not reach the sound or light.
He couldn't speak,
There were no friends.
Sometimes looking at the pictures of the trash that humans throw,
I imagined a place called land.
Laughing children, people running around, scenes that hug each other.
“I want to go there too.”
One day, he was pushed to the land near the land.
And in the sandy beach
I picked up small and blue shoes.
At first I just wore it.
I didn't have a feet, but it was strange.
And at that moment, he
I started walking.
It's been a long time since I left the sea.
Tralala walks on the beach.
People still see him and take pictures,
He does not see the loneliness of his eyes.
By the sunset every day, he stands in front of the waves
Gently take off your shoes.
Quietly look into the water and murmures like this.
"Who am I ... is a fish, a person ... or just… nobody."",
